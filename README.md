# CRUD-Struts2-EJB-JPA ðŸ¤™
This project contains a crud developed with struts 2, enterprise java beans and java persistence api.

This application uses:
- Java (Struts2)
- JPA (Java Persistence Api)
- EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)
- MVC (Model View Controller)

## Requirements ðŸ’»

- You need to create a persistence called "SgaPU" and a datasource "jdbc/PersonaDb", or just change their names in the file persistence.xml
- you could change the way to connect to the database, but remember the project works with JPA.

*Feel you free to use it* ðŸ¤“.
